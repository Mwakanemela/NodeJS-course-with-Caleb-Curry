- npm install uuid -> this package allows us to generate random ids
- git reset HEAD <directory-name> -> this helps to unstage a directory you have staged in git 
- package.json -> when you install dependencies it says what range of possible versions are okay to be used
- package-lock.json -> says what version of the package is actually being used
- add "type":"module" in package.json if you want to use import for importing modules (es6 type)
  require method is for default javascript
